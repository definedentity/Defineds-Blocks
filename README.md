# Defined's Blocks

This is a fabric mod that adds a bunch of my favourite blocks.

## Contents

- Undefined block: the primary block which will be used to craft Defined's blocks in a stonecutter
- Future block: Fake AE2 controller block, good for decorating
- Livingwood, livingrock, etc. from Botania
