# Defined's Blocks

This is a fabric mod that adds a bunch of my favourite blocks.

## Contents

- Undefined block: the primary block which will be used to craft Defined's blocks in a stonecutter
- Future block: Fake AE2 controller block, good for decorating

## Credits

- This mod use textures from [Applied-Energistics-2](https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2) for Future block
